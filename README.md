# Axon.NET

**Axon.NET** is a port of the popular Java based [AxonFramework](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework) for building Evolutionary Event-Driven Microservices in .NET.

The framework provides the necessary building blocks to follow principles of Domain Driven Design, Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Event Sourcing while incorporating async/await.
This implementation promise to maintain a similar API to that of the Java implementation, allowing you to refer to the official [AxonFramework Reference Guide](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/) for the time being.
